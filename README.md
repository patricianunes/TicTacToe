# Tic Tac Toe - Game


Overview
---


A game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! 

The objective of the project was to use all the technologies and knowledge that I have learned.

I wrote the project with **HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript and JQuery**. 

The JS logic and Dom manipulation was made in separeted filles.

I wrote the HTML and then start to make the CSS, when I have the visual my next step was to think about the logic and do the logic, finally acess the DOM and make everything works well.

After doing the basics I try to improve my code and make looks better, I focused in the CSS and try to make look pretty!

I really wanted to make my project the most simply possible, easy to read and understandable.

Still need some good thinks like, show who are playing, score of the players, but everything could be better and better.

## What I have Learned

By the time I submit this project, I covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:

**Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.

**Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.

**Programming Fundamentals**: Work with array, objects, event handlers and callbacks, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.

**Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.

**Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, Sass, and how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style for free.

**Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.

**Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

### My big Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use my programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- Separate **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** files in the application
- Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete

### Technical Requirements

#### My app must to have:

1. Render a game board in the browser
2. Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
3. Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"cat‚Äôs game" if neither wins
4. Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
5. Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
6. Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
7. Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
8. Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

<!-- ###Necessary Deliverables

A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
